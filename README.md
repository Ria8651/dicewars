# dicewars

A small [dicewars](https://www.gamedesign.jp/games/dicewars/) clone made in [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). Has most of the game mechanics from the original game, I just need to figure out how dice distribution is done and add the bonus dice mechanic.

You can try the game at [my site](https://bink.eu.org/dicewars/) (it takes a little while to load).
